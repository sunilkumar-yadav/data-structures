####Recursion
used in  trees , graph, dynamic problem , divide and conquer

Recursive method compromises of two elements
1. Recursive case - The case in which we have to call the method with different value
2. Base case - The case after which we do not make anymore recursive calls (Termination Condition)

How does recursion works internally?

e.g Find Factorial, Fibonacci Series

Recursion vs Iteration
- Space efficiency is good in iteration, We dont need any stack inniteration)
- Time/Execution Efficiency, In Iteration it is more time efficient, Push and Pop operation on stack takes some time which is avoided in iteration
- In recursion - ease of code.

Recursion is always used when we can breakdown the problem in similar sub problem.
For scenario where we have higher call stack we should avoid recursion.
